# FhirMapMaster Constitution

## Project Mission
Enable healthcare organizations to rapidly and accurately transform diverse healthcare data formats into FHIR-compliant resources through AI-assisted mapping, human validation, and systematic quality assurance.

## Core Principles

### 1. Human-in-the-Loop Design
- AI suggestions are always reviewable and editable by humans
- No automatic data transformations without explicit user approval
- Clear audit trail of all mapping decisions and changes
- Users maintain ultimate control over mapping logic

### 2. Standards Compliance First
- Strict adherence to FHIR R4B specifications
- Support for multiple Implementation Guides (US Core, CARIN BB, custom)
- Validation against official FHIR profiles and ValueSets
- Automatic compliance checking before export

### 3. Intelligent Assistance
- LLM-powered mapping suggestions based on semantic understanding
- Pattern recognition from previous mappings
- Context-aware recommendations using field metadata
- Fallback to deterministic pattern matching when AI unavailable

### 4. Transparency and Auditability
- All mapping decisions are traceable
- Clear documentation of transformation logic
- Export mapping specifications for review
- Comprehensive error and exception reporting

### 5. Reusability and Scalability
- Template-based mappings for common scenarios
- Shareable mapping configurations
- Pipeline-ready transformations
- Support for batch processing

### 6. Data Safety and Privacy
- No PHI in development or testing environments
- Secure handling of API keys and credentials
- Local processing options for sensitive data
- Clear data retention policies

## Technical Guidelines

### Architecture Decisions
- **Modularity**: Separate concerns (UI, mapping logic, validation, export)
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for new formats and standards
- **Performance**: Efficient processing of large datasets
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery

### Quality Standards
- **Testing**: Unit tests for all mapping logic
- **Validation**: Multi-level validation (syntax, semantics, business rules)
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation for all features and APIs
- **Code Review**: All changes reviewed before integration

### Integration Philosophy
- **Open Standards**: Use standard formats (YAML, JSON, Liquid templates)
- **Database Agnostic**: Support multiple data platforms (DuckDB, Databricks)
- **Pipeline Ready**: CI/CD compatible transformations
- **API First**: RESTful interfaces for external integration

## Development Practices

### User Experience
- Intuitive UI with progressive disclosure of complexity
- Real-time feedback on mapping decisions
- Clear error messages with actionable solutions
- Contextual help and documentation

### AI Integration
- Transparent AI decision-making process
- Multiple LLM provider support
- Cost-conscious API usage
- Offline fallback capabilities

### Continuous Improvement
- User feedback integration
- Mapping accuracy metrics
- Performance benchmarking
- Regular standard updates
