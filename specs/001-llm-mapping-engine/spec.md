# Specification: LLM-Powered FHIR Mapping Engine

## Overview
An intelligent mapping engine that leverages Large Language Models to suggest, validate, and optimize data field mappings to FHIR resources, with human-in-the-loop review capabilities.

## Problem Statement
Healthcare organizations struggle with:
- Manual mapping of hundreds of data fields to FHIR resources
- Understanding complex FHIR specifications and cardinality rules
- Maintaining consistency across similar mappings
- Identifying optimal FHIR resource types for source data

## User Stories

### As a Data Analyst
- I want AI to suggest FHIR mappings based on my field names and sample data
- I want to review and modify AI suggestions before applying them
- I want the system to learn from my corrections for future mappings
- I want confidence scores for each mapping suggestion

### As a Healthcare IT Manager
- I want to reduce mapping time from weeks to hours
- I want consistent mapping quality across different analysts
- I want audit trails of all mapping decisions
- I want to reuse successful mappings across projects

### As a Compliance Officer
- I want validation that mappings meet FHIR standards
- I want reports on mapping coverage and exceptions
- I want to ensure PHI is handled appropriately
- I want documentation of mapping rationale
